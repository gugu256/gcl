# gcl - gugu256's C Library
I'm trying to create a personal library to make it easier for me to code in C. Feel free to contribute if you've already coded things that are still in the to do list!
#### TO DO:

- [ ] better string comparisons
- [ ] something better than scanf()

- [ ] starts_with()
- [ ] ends_with()

#### DONE:
- [x] write_file()
- [x] read_file()
- [x] printing text to the terminal with colors (color.h)
