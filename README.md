# gcl - gugu256's C Library
I'm trying to create a personal library to make it easier for me to code in C. Feel free to contribute if you've already coded things that are still in the to do list!
#### TO DO:

- [ ] better strings
- [ ] something better than scanf()
- [ ] readfile()
- [ ] writefile()
- [ ] startswith()
- [ ] endswith()

#### DONE:
- [x] printing text to the terminal with colors (color.h)
