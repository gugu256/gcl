# gcl - gugu256's C Library
I'm trying to create a personal library to make it easier for me to code in C. Feel free to contribute if you've already coded things that are still in the to do list!
#### TO DO:

- [ ] something better than scanf()


- [ ] equivalents to shell commands (cd, mkdir, pwd, ls)
- [ ] error handling
- [ ] document the funcs/comment them

#### DONE:
- [x] str_is_in()
- [x] str_ends_with()
- [x] str_starts_with()
- [x] str_is_equal() (string)
- [x] write_file()
- [x] read_file()
- [x] printing text to the terminal with colors (color.h)
